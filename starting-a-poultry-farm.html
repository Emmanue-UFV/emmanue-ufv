        <p><strong><a id="What%is%poultry%farming?"> 1. What is poultry farming?</a></strong></p>
        <p><em>Poultry farming</em> is a type of animal husbandry in which domesticated birds such as chickens, ducks, turkeys, and geese are raised to provide meat or eggs for human use. Poultry, mostly chickens, are raised in large quantities. Every year, more than 60 billion chickens are slaughtered for human consumption. <br>Layers are birds grown for eggs, whereas broilers are chickens reared for meat. You can check <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/poultry-farming" target="_blank">here for more information</a></p>

            </figure>
            <p>Interestingly, While Nigeria has the largest yearly egg output and the second biggest chicken population in Africa, local production only covers 30% of the demand for chicken eggs and meat, indicating that there is enormous room for growth in the business. You can become a <strong>major stakeholder</strong> in this business! </p>

<p><strong><a id="Factors%to%consider%before%starting%your%poultry%farm"> 3. Factors to consider before starting your poultry farm</a></strong></p>
        <p>All businesses, including agri-business, such as poultry farming, must follow unique operating guidelines in order to produce a reasonable profit. Below are some factors you need to properly consider before venturing into poultry farming:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Source of capital: where is your initial investement coming from? savings or loans?</li>
            <li>Type of Products: what type of poultry product are you intending? You need to consider your target market before selecting the products you want to sell the most. </li>
            <li>Farm location: For you to succeed, the location you select must have everything needed to run your business, such as proximity and access to market, security, etc. Also, consider siting your farm away from residential areas, due to the odors that emanate from poultry farms.</li>
            <li>Availability of facilities and equipments:  Once  the location has been selected, you will need to construct a solid house and grazing area for your birds, as well as procuring necessary equipments.</li>
            <li>Farm hands: Depending on the size of the farm, you will most likey need farm hands. Ensure you hire the right number of trustworthy people.</li>
            <li>Marketing: The ultimate goal of establishing your poultry farm is to sell to the market, so this is a very impotant aspect (<em>we have an e-market in place to help you reach more consumers, you can always <a href="e-market.html">check it out)</a></em></li>
